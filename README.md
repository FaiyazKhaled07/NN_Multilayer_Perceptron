# NN_Multilayer_Perceptron
The dataset “dataset.csv” contains entries about environmental factors of the different habitats and different types of amphibians living in those habitats. The dataset has several features.
In this project I have used Multi-layer Perceptron classifier to create different Neural Networks with different parameters to predict two types of amphibians living in those habitats with accuracy result.
